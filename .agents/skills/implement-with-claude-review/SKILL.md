description: Implement a plan or scoped change, verify it, obtain a read-only Claude review, validate and fix confirmed findings, then report in Traditional Chinese with a purpose-led per-file summary explaining why each change exists and which development responsibility it fulfills. Use for end-to-end implementation requests that require Claude or cross-model review. Fall back to an independent Codex review when Claude is unavailable and disclose the reason.

# Implement with Claude Review

Codex owns implementation, final technical judgment, fixes, verification, and reporting. Claude is a read-only reviewer.

## Workflow

1. Read the requirements, repository instructions, and starting `git status`; preserve unrelated changes.
2. Implement without committing, pushing, deploying, or expanding scope unless requested.
3. Run proportionate checks.
4. Request a read-only Claude review against the requirements, diff, and check results.
5. Validate every finding; accept only concrete correctness, regression, security, requirement, or meaningful test-coverage issues.
6. Fix accepted findings and rerun affected checks. Reject style-only, speculative, or false-positive findings.
7. If fixes are material, run one final pass with the same reviewer. Maximum: two review passes.
8. Report the result in Traditional Chinese using the format below.

## Claude Review

Use Claude Opus unless the user requests another model. Run non-interactively in plan/read-only mode:

A typical invocation is:

```bash
claude -p "<focused review prompt>" \
  --model opus \
  --permission-mode plan \
  --tools "Read,Grep,Glob,Bash"
```

Include the requirements, implementation scope, changed files or diff, checks, and pre-existing changes to ignore. Require severity, file/line, failure mode, and fix direction. Exclude formatting, naming, subjective style, and unrelated improvements. Treat findings as evidence, not authority.

## Claude Failure Fallback

If Claude returns no usable review—because of access, quota, policy, authentication, timeout, tooling, context, or malformed output—retry once only when the invocation is clearly correctable; otherwise use independent Codex review:

```bash
codex -C "$PWD" review -
```

Pass the same review context through stdin. Immediately identify the fallback with the specific, sanitized reason:

```text
Review provider: Codex (fallback — Claude unavailable: <specific reason>)
```

After fallback, use Codex for remaining passes and count them toward the two-pass limit. State that the review was independent, not cross-model, and never imply Claude approved it. If fallback also fails, report both failures and stop review work.

## Final Report

Write explanations and headings in Traditional Chinese; preserve commands, identifiers, paths, model names, and required provider labels. Lead with outcomes, not chronology. Use exactly these sections:

```markdown
## 實作結果

- 第一點先說明本次開發要解決的使用者／系統問題、原本缺少的能力，以及完成後具備的能力。
- 其餘 1–3 點列出使用者可見行為與重要架構結果。

## 檔案摘要

### `path/to/file.ts` — 新增／修改／刪除／重新命名

- **開發目的**：先指出這個檔案承接哪一項需求或使用情境、原本的缺口／風險，以及它在整體開發中負責完成什麼能力。
- **具體變更**：指出變更的元件、函式、型別、schema、route、設定鍵或測試案例，以及各自改了什麼。
- **設計理由**：說明為什麼選擇這個 boundary、資料結構或流程，以及它如何滿足限制或避免已知風險；沒有非顯而易見的設計判斷時省略。
- **行為與資料流**：說明重要條件、狀態轉換、輸入輸出、錯誤處理或呼叫鏈的前後差異；不適用時省略。
- **驗證重點**：列出這個檔案所涵蓋或新增的成功、失敗與邊界案例；若只由整體檢查涵蓋，指出對應命令。

## Review 結果

- 每一 pass 的 provider、finding、接受／拒絕與對應修正。

## 驗證

- `command`：結果與重要計數。

## 剩餘風險

- 只列具體風險或未完成步驟；沒有則明確說明。
```

Build `檔案摘要` from starting status and final diff. Include every task-owned source, test, support, config, documentation, deletion, rename, and review fix; exclude pre-existing user changes. Create one subsection per path and list each path exactly once.

Make every entry concrete enough that the user can understand the implementation without opening the diff:

- Derive `開發目的` from the plan, acceptance criteria, user scenario, or scoped requirements before reading the diff as an implementation inventory. Do not infer purpose only from symbol names or restate the mechanics as intent.
- Make the role of each file in the overall change explicit: identify what development responsibility it owns, why that responsibility belongs there, and which downstream behavior or requirement depends on it.
- Keep `開發目的`, `具體變更`, and `設計理由` distinct: purpose explains why the capability is needed; concrete change explains what was implemented; design rationale explains why this implementation shape was chosen.
- Name the important symbols, UI regions, endpoints, data fields, configuration keys, or test scenarios changed in that file.
- Describe meaningful before/after behavior, including branching, fallback, validation, state, persistence, side effects, and error handling when relevant.
- For tests, name the exact behavior and edge cases covered and the expected outcome; do not merely say that tests were added.
- For configuration, migrations, generated support files, and documentation, identify the exact entries or sections changed and their runtime or developer-facing effect.
- For deletions, explain which responsibility was removed and where it moved or why it is no longer needed. For renames, show `old/path → new/path` and state whether content also changed.
- Identify changes originating from accepted review findings in the affected file entry.

Avoid vague summaries such as “更新邏輯”, “改善型別”, “重構元件”, “補上測試”, or “調整設定”. Prefer 2–5 information-dense bullets per file, expanding when a file contains multiple independent changes. Do not paste the diff or narrate trivial line-by-line edits.

Use this distinction:

```markdown
<!-- Too mechanical: the reader knows what changed but not why it exists. -->
- **具體變更**：新增 `redactReviewRequestV1` 與三種 detector。

<!-- Purpose-led: the reader can reconstruct the intended development. -->
- **開發目的**：在 `ReviewEngine` 前建立單向 sanitization boundary，避免啟用 cloud transport 時把 diff 中常見的 API key 或 private key 原文送出本機；這個檔案負責 Plan 14 的核心 redacted-request contract。
- **具體變更**：新增 `redactReviewRequestV1`、deterministic replacement tokens，以及 API key、private key、high-entropy token detectors。
- **設計理由**：對完整 request tree 做一次純 traversal，讓 path、patch、prompt 與 model 共用同一政策，避免各 engine adapter 各自 redaction 而產生漏接或行為分歧。
```

State whether Claude completed review. For fallback, repeat the exact provider label and reason, and never imply Claude approved the work.
